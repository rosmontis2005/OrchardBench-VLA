"""Configuration for procedural tree generation and simulation.

* "Gentle Manipulation of Tree Branches: A Contact-Aware Policy Learning
  Approach", Jacob et al., CoRL 2024 (PMLR v270).  The paper models branches
  as *rigid cylindrical links* connected by *torsional mass-spring-dampers*

Everything the user asked to be "optional" is a boolean / enum here so a tree
can be built rigid-only, or progressively upgraded with deformability,
breaking and foliage.
